This program is started by Eggert Ehmke <eggert.ehmke@berlin.de> and Ulrich Weigelt <ulrich.weigelt@gmx.de>.
Current maintainer is Johnny A. Solbu <johnny@solbu.net>.

It is distributed under the GNU public license. See COPYING for details.
It is based on the command line tool showmail written by Manfred Haertel,
Manfred.Haertel@rz-online.de.

Kshowmail is a KDE tool to watch mails on a POP3 server.
Headers and complete mails can be viewed without loading them to the
local mail client. Unpleasant mail can be deleted from the server.
The list of displayed mails can be refreshed via configurable timers.
Filters can be assigned to mark known spam or ignore nonrelevant mails or mailing list mails.
Multiple accounts are supported.
A sound can be played if new mail arrives.

The modifications I provided are mainly Qt/KDE stuff to generate a nice
GUI interface. I am using the great development tool KDevelop.

If you find the tool useful, tell me about it. If you find any bugs or
want some additional features, just give me a hint. As time allows,
I will try to fix them. If you like to translate the language files,
I would be very happy.

Have a lot of fun! ;-)
